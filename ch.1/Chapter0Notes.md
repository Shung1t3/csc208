# Chapter 0 Notes

## Implication or Conditional

P --> Q

- P is the hypothesis(antecedent)
- Q is the conclusion(consequent)

The thing about it is the only way the statement can be false is if P is true and then Q is false. Any other scenario would yield true. 


# **Direct Proofs**

use variables and equals signs to create a proof of a word problem.       

Assign parts of the word problem to variables.   

>Suppose the numbers a and b are even. This means that
a = 2k and b = 2j for some integers k and j. The sum is then
a + b = 2k + 2j = 2(k + j). Since k + j is an integer, this means that
a + b is even.


since every other scenario yields true, the only way for a conditional to be false is if the hypothesis is true but the conclusion is not. 


the equation is broken into two parts but you can't tell from the equals signs. This is because the problem is now being represented as an equation, not as sentences. Since we assume that p is true, and q must be true if p is true, then anything is false then the equation is false.    

## **Converse and Contrapositive Defenitions**

converse
:  The converse is the reverse of the statements.      

The converse of p &#8594; Q id Q &#8594; P. This statement does not mean the same thing as the first statement. <mark>This also means that the converse could be true or false. Converses of implications should be considered case by case.</mark>



contrapositive
: an implication and its contrapositives are always the same. **Both true or both false.**   

The Contrapositive of P &#8594; Q is ¬ P &#8594; ¬Q   



## Finding if Converse is true or false and is uses
This quote helps demonstratehow to prove the converse:  
>Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an
implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis
is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the
conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).
